# Statistical Data Viewer on IPFS

### 1. What is your project? (max 100 words)

We are building a web-app to save and monitor your data via IPFS. Our program scans your IPFS cache folder to show a detailed summary of what is stored on your IPFS node. The data will be visualized using organized colorful graphics similar to apps like Windirstat, Spacesniffer, or Disk Recon. Each file type (MP3, ZIP, EXE, JPEG, etc.) is assigned a color in a collage of rectangles that are sized depending on how much space that file type is using.

### 2. How are you planning to improve this project? (max 200 words)

Add more features and improving the data monitoring capabilities of our CID Management tool. With our easy to use statistical data visualization tool, users will have a better way to understand the statistics of the data they save on IPFS. We are using the JS-IPFS HTTP API's to do the communication to our web-app. The better we get with IPFS, the more we can certainly build.
