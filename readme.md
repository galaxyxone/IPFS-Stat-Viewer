# Statistical Data Viewer on IPFS

### A simple chrome extension for users to visualize the data stored on their local IPFS node



We are building a web-app to save and monitor your data via IPFS. Our program scans your IPFS cache folder to show a detailed summary of what is stored on your IPFS node. The data will be visualized using organized colorful graphics similar to apps like Windirstat, Spacesniffer, or Disk Recon. Each file type (MP3, ZIP, EXE, JPEG, etc.) is assigned a color in a collage of rectangles that are sized depending on how much space that file type is using.
